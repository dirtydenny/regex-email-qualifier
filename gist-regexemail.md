<h2 style="text-align: center;">RegEx:  Regular Expression – Email matching</h2>

Have you ever signed up for a website you really didn’t want to signup to with a fake email address that looked like “asdfhlkajlkdjf” only to have it rejected as an invalid email address?  That fancy bit of gobbledygook above is what made you craft a more reasonable noemail@nomail.com fake address instead.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are assertions about the engine's current position in the string.  In our email testing regex we are using ^ and $.  The ^ will assert the beginning of the regex and the $ will assert the end.  ^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$
